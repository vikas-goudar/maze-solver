Alogirthm: Recursive back tracker and stack
This ensures that each node is visitable by every other node 
  Select a node 
  Add node to the stack {Link I}
  Mark the node as being visited
  Check for any unvisited neighbours of the node {Link II}
    If exists
      Set neighbour as current node
      Continue from {Link I}
    If not exists
      Pop the current node from the stack
      Set the top most node as current node 
      Continue from {link II}
This creates a path and to show this visully we draw lines between nodes that aren't connect directly on the path we are able to create walls that surround the path that we made which enforces the path set by the algorithm thus creating a maze
