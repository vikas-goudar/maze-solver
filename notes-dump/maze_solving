Dijkstra's algorithm

it finds the shortest distance from a node to every other node 

set the value of each node as infinity/null and the starting node as 0
set the starting node as the current node

update the values of the neighbours of the current node that aren't visited if needed { if current + connection < node value }
add the current node into a 'visited set'
choose a cells with the least value that isn't visited and mark it as current node
repeat the process until the ending node is found or if all nodes are visisted 
{ if you don't find the ending node that means that there no possible path }

then backtrack from the final node visiting the nodes with the lowest value.
