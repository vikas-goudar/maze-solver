-> maze generation algorithms
-> maze solving algorithms
-> gui with option to select between different algorithms
-> performance analysis of the different algorithms 
  -> for maze generation
    -> use dijkstra to show the biases of mazes using colors
    -> can show number of dead ends by coloring on basis of passages connected
    -> con show ratio of horizontal vs vertical passages
-> for maze solution
  -> paths taken to reach the final node
